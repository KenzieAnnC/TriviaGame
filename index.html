                <p>If you're looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money but what I do have are a very particular set of skills.
                        
                </p> Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.</p> 
                
                <p>If you answer all these trivia questions correctly, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you.</p>
                
                <p>But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you.</p>
